# MinecraftServerSharp
Minecraft server implementation in C#  
Note that this is currently just a passion project and the points below are more of a vision for the future of this project. 

***

#### 🧩🌎 Extendable and Cross-platform
Plugins will play a big role in implementing game logic and later on extensibility similar to mainstream Minecraft servers. 
Utilising a modern and unified .NET allows the server to run on most mainstream devices and architectures. 

#### ⚡🧵 Performant and Threaded  
This implementation aims to provide great performance by utilising modern practises, new technologies, and few allocations. 
Threading many aspects of the server is of great importance as modern/server processors usually have plenty of cores.
